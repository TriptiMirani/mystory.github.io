"MyStory" is a personal website where I, the programmer behind this project, share the journey of my life and career through a short story. The website is a creative and interactive way to explore the experiences, challenges, and achievements that have shaped me into who I am today. By clicking on ["Click here to see MyStory,"](https://triptimirani.github.io/mystory.github.io/) visitors can delve into a narrative that combines text, visuals, and interactive elements to tell my story.
